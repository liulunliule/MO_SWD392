## Basic System Requirements to Run Flutter

Before you can start using Flutter on your machine, you need to make sure the following requirements are met:

1. **Flutter SDK**: Ensure that Flutter is installed on your machine. If not, follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Dart SDK**: Flutter comes with Dart SDK, which is installed alongside it.
3. **IDE**: Use an IDE such as Android Studio, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
4. **Xcode (for iOS development)**: If you're developing for iOS, you need to install Xcode on macOS.
5. **Android Studio (for Android development)**: Make sure Android Studio is installed and properly set up.

To check if Flutter is installed and configured correctly, run the following command:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command will check your environment and display a report of the status of your installation.
